            <h3>Email Client Configuration</h3>

The configuration typically involves setting up both incoming and outgoing mail servers with the appropriate security protocols.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Common Issues and Troubleshooting Tips</h2>
            <div class="troubleshooting-list">
                <h4>Frequently Encountered Problems</h4>
                
                <p><strong>Login Issues:</strong> If you're unable to access your account, first verify your username and password. Check for caps lock and ensure you're using the correct login credentials. Clear your browser cache and cookies if accessing through a web browser.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Email Sending Problems:</strong> When emails aren't being sent, verify your outgoing server settings. Check your internet connection and ensure you haven't exceeded any sending limits. Verify that your email client is properly configured with the correct SMTP settings.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Email Receiving Issues:</strong> If you're not receiving emails, check your spam or junk folder first. Verify your incoming server settings and ensure your mailbox isn't full. Check if any filters or rules are blocking incoming messages.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Synchronization Problems:</strong> For sync issues across devices, ensure all devices are using the same server settings. Check your internet connection and verify that IMAP is properly configured if you want emails to sync across multiple devices.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Password Recovery:</strong> If you've forgotten your password, use the official password reset feature. This typically involves answering security questions or receiving a reset link via an alternate email address.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Advanced Troubleshooting</h3>
            <p>For more complex issues, you may need to check firewall settings, antivirus configurations, or network connectivity problems. Some email clients may require specific port configurations or security certificate updates.</p>

            <p>Maintaining the security of your Roadrunner Email account is crucial in today's digital environment. Here are essential security practices:</p>
            
            <h3>Password Security</h3>
            <p>Use strong, unique passwords that include a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters. Avoid using the same password for multiple accounts and consider using a password manager for better security.</p>
            
            <h3>Two-Factor Authentication</h3>
            <p>Enable two-factor authentication if available to add an extra layer of security to your account. This prevents unauthorized access even if your password is compromised.</p>
            
            <h3>Regular Account Monitoring</h3>
            <p>Regularly check your account activity and immediately report any suspicious activities to support. Monitor your sent folder for emails you didn't send and check for any unauthorized account changes.</p>

            <h3>Data Backup</h3>
